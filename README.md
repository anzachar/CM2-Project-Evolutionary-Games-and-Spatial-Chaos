# CM2-Project-Evolutionary-Games-and-Spatial-Chaos
This repository is dedicated to the project I completed within the framework of the course "Computational Mathematics II" during my MSc in Computational Physics. The aim of the project is to replicate the results produced by  Martin A. Nowak and Robert M. May in their paper "Evolutionary Games and Chaos" (1992, Letters to Nature)
