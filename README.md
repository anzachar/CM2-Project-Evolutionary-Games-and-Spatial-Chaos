# Computational Mathematics II Project: Evolutionary Games and Spatial Chaos
This repository is dedicated to the project I completed as part of the "Computational Mathematics II" course during my MSc in Computational Physics. The project's objective was to replicate the results produced by Martin A. Nowak and Robert M. May in their paper "Evolutionary Games and Chaos" (1992, Letters to Nature). To achieve this, I developed a Python program using Jupyter Notebook, which allowed for better visualization of the results.
